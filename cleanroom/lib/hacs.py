"""HACS WebSocket commands — institutional knowledge from the v1.3.0→HEAD
manual cleanroom run.

If you change anything in this file, verify against a known-good cleanroom run
first — these command names + shapes are NOT well-documented upstream and were
discovered empirically.

Command-name surprises (do not "fix" without verifying):

* `hacs/repositories/add` — NOT `hacs/install` or `hacs/add`.
  Payload: `{repository: "<owner>/<repo>", category: "integration"}`.
  After add, sleep ~8s then re-list to find the assigned numeric `id`.

* `hacs/repository/download` — NOT `hacs/install` or `hacs/repository/install`.
  Payload: `{repository: "<numeric-id>", version: "<git-tag>"}`.
  Note: the field is `repository` (the ID), not `repository_id`. The `version`
  field takes the literal git tag string (e.g. `v1.3.0`).

* `hacs/repositories/list` — returns `{success: bool, result: [<repo>, ...]}`.
  Each repo has `id`, `full_name`, `installed`, `installed_version`,
  `available_version`, `category`, `custom`, `downloaded`.

* `hacs/repository {repository_id, action: "show"}` — per-repo detail. Uses
  `repository_id` (different field name from /download — yes, really).

The WS connection MUST use `max_size=20 MiB` (see ha_ws.py) — HACS responses
exceed the 1 MiB default.

Restart-after-download requirement: `hacs/repository/download` writes files to
`<config>/custom_components/<repo>/` but does NOT load the integration. The
container must be restarted (or the integration manually loaded) for HA to
pick it up.
